# VNC Security and Password Confirmation

This document outlines the VNC password confirmation and security features implemented in the Dwarf Fortress container.

## Overview

The container now includes comprehensive VNC password security with confirmation mechanisms to ensure secure remote access to your Dwarf Fortress installation.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Password Confirmation During Installation

The `install.sh` script now includes an interactive password setup with confirmation:

- **Dual Password Entry**: Users must enter the password twice to confirm accuracy
- **Length Validation**: VNC passwords are limited to 8 characters (VNC protocol limitation)
- **Empty Password Warning**: Clear warnings when no password is set
- **Secure Input**: Password input is hidden during entry

```bash
Enter VNC password (8 characters max): ********
Confirm VNC password: ********
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Passwords are securely stored in a `.env` file that's created during installation:

```bash
# .env file contents
VNC_PASSWORD=your_password_here
```

### 3. Container Health Checks

Both containers now include health checks to ensure proper VNC connectivity:

**Dwarf Fortress Container:**
- Tests VNC server is listening on port 5900
- 30-second intervals with 5-second timeout
- 30-second startup grace period

**noVNC Container:**
- Validates VNC connection before allowing web access
- Uses custom validation script
- Depends on Dwarf Fortress container health

### 4. VNC Validation Scripts

#### `validate-vnc.sh`
Comprehensive VNC connection validator that:
- Tests VNC server connectivity
- Validates password configuration
- Provides detailed error reporting
- Supports multiple operation modes

#### `test-vnc-connection.sh` 
Simple connection test script that:
- Shows connection information
- Tests VNC server availability
- Displays container status
- Provides troubleshooting guidance

### 5. Enhanced Startup Script

The `start.sh` script now includes:
- Password length validation and truncation
- Secure password file creation with proper permissions
- VNC server connection verification
- Improved error handling and cleanup

## Usage

### Installation with Password

```bash
# Run the installer
./install.sh

# Follow the prompts for password setup
Enter VNC password (8 characters max): mypass123
Confirm VNC password: mypass123
```

### Testing VNC Connection

```bash
# Test the connection
./test-vnc-connection.sh

# Validate VNC setup
./validate-vnc.sh
```

### Connecting to VNC

**Desktop VNC Client:**
```
Host: your-server-ip:5900
Password: [your configured password]
```

**Web Browser (noVNC):**
```
URL: http://your-server-ip:6080
Password: [your configured password]
```

## Security Benefits

1. **Password Protection**: Prevents unauthorized access to your Dwarf Fortress instance
2. **Confirmation**: Reduces password entry errors through dual confirmation
3. **Validation**: Built-in scripts verify connection integrity
4. **Health Checks**: Container orchestration ensures services are properly secured
5. **Error Prevention**: Clear validation prevents common configuration mistakes

## Troubleshooting

### Password Issues

If you experience password-related problems:

1. **Check Password Length**: VNC passwords must be 8 characters or less
2. **Verify .env File**: Ensure the password is correctly stored in `.env`
3. **Test Connection**: Use `./test-vnc-connection.sh` to diagnose issues
4. **Check Logs**: Review container logs with `docker-compose logs dwarf-fortress`

### Common Solutions

```bash
# Reset password in .env file
echo "VNC_PASSWORD=newpass" >> .env

# Restart containers to apply changes
docker-compose restart

# Test the new configuration
./test-vnc-connection.sh
```

### Container Health Issues

If containers report unhealthy status:

```bash
# Check container status
docker-compose ps

# View health check logs
docker inspect dwarf-fortress-ai | grep -A 20 Health

# Restart unhealthy containers
docker-compose restart dwarf-fortress novnc
```

## Configuration Files Modified

The following files were enhanced with password confirmation features:

- `install.sh` - Interactive password setup with confirmation
- `docker-compose.yml` - Health checks and dependency management
- `start.sh` - VNC password validation and secure setup
- `Dockerfile` - Added netcat for health checking
- `README.md` - Updated documentation

## Scripts Added

- `validate-vnc.sh` - Comprehensive VNC validation
- `test-vnc-connection.sh` - Simple connection testing
- `VNC-SECURITY.md` - This documentation file

## Security Best Practices

1. **Use Strong Passwords**: Choose passwords with mixed characters within the 8-character limit
2. **Regular Updates**: Consider changing VNC passwords periodically
3. **Network Security**: Use VPN or SSH tunneling for connections over untrusted networks
4. **Monitor Access**: Check container logs regularly for unauthorized access attempts
5. **Firewall Rules**: Restrict VNC port access to trusted IP addresses when possible

## Backward Compatibility

The system maintains backward compatibility:
- Existing installations without passwords continue to work
- Empty passwords are supported (with warnings)
- All previous management commands remain functional
- Docker Compose configurations are preserved

## Support
